## Description
Raytracing project created for Graphics Programming class written in C++

## Running Locally
Created by Gavin Baltar and Donald Arango

- Run the makefile in the root directory
    - This was run on a mac, so if there are any issues let us know, because we can attempt to help for running on windows.
- The program then asks for input
    - 1 for perspective camera
    - 0 for orthographic camera
- Enjoy!
